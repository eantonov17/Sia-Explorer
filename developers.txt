The Sia block explorer is a javascript page that makes http requests to an
explorer-enabled sia daemon and formats the results into human-friendly pages.

When testing, please view all of these pages for correctness (some include corner cases):

Currently, the explorer ignores all payouts that are found in file contracts
and file contract revisions. For storage proofs, it will show what the payouts
were for submitting a valid proof. There is currently no way to view the missed
storage proofs and their corresponding outputs. In general, outputs from file
contracts are poorly handled and often hidden entirely.
